<code>A_Plotting_Project_in_Python_using_Matplotlib.html</code> This project consists in data manipulation and plotting composite graphs by using matplotlib. | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/A_Plotting_Project_in_Python_using_Matplotlib.html</sub>
<code>Creating_a_Customized_Visualization.html</code> This project is a Python implementation of an idea discussed in a paper from Ferreira, Fisher and Konig, which allows visualizing a plot that helps in making judgements about probabilistic data generated through samples. It produces an interactive plot. (Please note that sometimes ipynb files are hard to download in GitHub.) | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/Creating_a_Customized_Visualization.ipynb</sub>
<code>Hypothesis_Test_with_Python_Pandas.html</code> This project consists in retrieving and manipulating data from different files and then performing a hypothesis test. | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/Hypothesis_Test_with_Python_Pandas.html</sub>
<code>Data_Retrievial_Cleansing_Manipulation_with_Pandas.html</code> In this project, three files are loaded in Python as Pandas dataframes. Those dataframes are cleansed and then merged into a single data set. The dataset is further manipulated to find average values, max values, etc ... New columns are added to calculate new variables. Then data from a Python dictionary is added to do further data manipulation and new dataframes are created. The work has been done by using Juniper Notebook. | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/Data_Retrievial_Cleansing_Manipulation_with_Pandas.html</sub>
