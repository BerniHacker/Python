<code>Data_Retrievial_Cleansing_Manipulation_with_Pandas.ipynb</code> This project consists in retrieving and manipulating data from different files and then performing a hypothesis test. | <sub>https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/Data_Retrievial_Cleansing_Manipulation_with_Pandas.ipynb</sub>
<code>Data_Retrievial_Cleansing_Manipulation_with_Pandas.ipynb</code> In this project, three files are loaded in Python as Panda dataframes. Those dataframes are cleansed and then merged into a single data set. The dataset is further manipulated to find average values, max values, etc ... New columns are added to calculate new variables. Then data from a Python dictionary is added to do further data manipulation and new dataframes are created. The work has been done by using Juniper Notebook. | <sub>https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/Data_Retrievial_Cleansing_Manipulation_with_Pandas.ipynb</sub>
