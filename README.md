<code>Time_Use_in_Finland</code> A Data Cleansing and Visualization Project in Python. | <sub>https://github.com/BerniHacker/Time_Use_in_Finland/blob/master/README.md</sub>
<code>Creating_a_Customized_Visualization.html</code> This project is a Python implementation of an idea discussed in a paper from Ferreira, Fisher and Konig, which allows visualizing a plot that helps in making judgements about probabilistic data generated through samples. It produces an interactive plot. (In order to test the interactive feature, copy and paste the source code to your Jupyter Notebook environment.) | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/Creating_a_Customized_Visualization.html</sub>
<code>A_Plotting_Project_in_Python_using_Matplotlib.html</code> This project consists in data manipulation and plotting composite graphs by using matplotlib. | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/A_Plotting_Project_in_Python_using_Matplotlib.html</sub>
<code>Hypothesis_Test_with_Python_Pandas.html</code> This project consists in retrieving and manipulating data from different files and then performing a hypothesis test. | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/Hypothesis_Test_with_Python_Pandas.html</sub>
<code>Data_Retrievial_Cleansing_Manipulation_with_Pandas.html</code> In this project, three files are loaded in Python as Pandas dataframes. Those dataframes are cleansed and then merged into a single data set. The dataset is further manipulated to find average values, max values, etc ... New columns are added to calculate new variables. Then data from a Python dictionary is added to do further data manipulation and new dataframes are created. The work has been done by using Jupyter Notebook. | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/Data_Retrievial_Cleansing_Manipulation_with_Pandas.html</sub>
<code>Scraping_Web_Pages.py</code> The program asks the user to insert a URL and then reads the HTML, searches for a link that is in a user-provided position respect to the top of the page and follows that link. The process is repeated a user-defined number of times and returns the visible text corresponding to the last found link. Validation of user input is performed. | <sub>https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/Scraping_Web_Pages.py</sub>
<code>Using_a_Web_Service.html</code> This program prompts for a location, contacts a web service, retrieves JSON data corresponding to the web service and the user-defined location and finds some data. | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/Using_a_Web_Service.html</sub>
<code>Extracting_JSON_Data.html</code> This program prompts for a URL, reads the JSON data from that URL, extracts some data and does some calculation. | <sub>http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/Extracting_JSON_Data.html</sub>
<code>Extracting_XML_Data.py</code> This program prompts for a URL, reads the XML data from that URL, extracts some data and does some calculation. | <sub>https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/Extracting_XML_Data.py</sub>
<code>Finding10MostCommonWords.py</code> A simple Python script using dictionaries, lists and tuples | <sub>https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/Finding10MostCommonWords.py</sub>
<code>MostFrequentEmailAddress.py</code> A simple Python script using dictionaries | <sub>https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/MostFrequentEmailAddress.py</sub>
<code>ComputePay.py</code> A simple Python script using a function | <sub>https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/CalculatePay.py</sub>
<code>MaxAndMinNumber.py</code> A simple Python script using conditional statements and loops | <sub>https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/MaxAndMinNumber.py</sub>
<code>WorkingWithFiles.py</code> A simple Python script using a file | <sub>https://github.com/BerniHacker/Python/blob/master/WorkingWithFiles.py</sub>
